# ERP_group3
Two different instances of the DBC experiment, per subject predictions not possible. Per item instead
90 sentences
For each sentence there are 3 conditions (baseline, event related, event urelated)
We average the reading time per sentence-condition
For each electrode we get the N400 and P600 components per sentence-condition
We predict reading time from N400 and P600 per condition
The linear regression revealed that for each condition there are certain electrode that perform better. when we take the best electrodes for each condition and use them in linear regression we get these result:

!TO DO!:
Get the RNN to be as accurate as possible
Run the linear regression the other way as well (RT as input, N400/P600 as output)
